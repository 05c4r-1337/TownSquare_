# Webased Application in ASP.NET and Entity Framework
This project is called Townsquare and it is a central hub where community members can post 
and view about events that are upcomming or even create events where other people can register
and join in on the fun. Anyone in the community can view the events but only registered users
can sign up and see who else signed up.

Townsquare is a user friendly and easy to navigate website for people who want to connect with 
people in their community or find something to do in the area, such as markets, partys, birthdays
etc. 

The Townsquare website is relativley easy to navigate, in the navbar you have the **Townsquare** text 
that works as a homepage button, next to that you have the **Events** button that takes you
either as an unregistered user to the events in the community where you can view what is happening
or as a registered user not only can you view the events in the area but you can also, create new events
and also see who signed up. There is also a search function where you can search for certain keywords,
dates, descriptions. 

While browsing through the events if the event is not too far into the future you can also see what
type of weather there will be during the event.

If you are logged in as a user and have created an event, when another user Registers to your
event you will get a notification that tells you what user has registered to your event. 

For events that you as a user have created you can also edit and delete that event.

For admins you can edit and delete other users events.
the login for admin is admin@townsquare.com with the password admin, if you want to test the functions.
